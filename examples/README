* Examples for use of NBI in Laplace and Helmholtz problems

Each directory has a self-contained example which is run by calling
the executable script. The script will generate a geometry (in the
subdirectory Geometries), assemble a matrix (stored in the subdirectory
Matrices), solve for some specified boundary condition, and return an
error estimate based on the known solution.

The error estimate is computed as the difference between the potential
specified in the boundary condition file, and that computed by the
solver. Each example script also generates gmsh mesh files for
visualization; these can be viewed using gmsh.

SphereLaplace: solve for the Laplace potential on a sphere under
	       excitation from an internal point source. To run the
	       example in the directory,

	       ./sphere-laplace

SphereHelmholtz: solve for the Helmholtz (wave equation) potential on
		 a sphere under excitation from a sinusoidally varying
		 ring source (this can be used to simulate rotor and
		 propeller noise). To run the example in the
		 directory,

		 ./sphere-helmholtz

Scattering: solve for scattering of a plane wave by a sphere, with
	    comparison to the analytical series solution. To run the
	    example in the directory,

	    ./sphere-scattering

Rotor: solve the problem of scattering of noise from an azimuthally
       varying circular source, which simulates a rotor interacting
       with a simple nacelle

* Parameters

nqp:      number of quadrature points on discretized patches
nqu:      number of quadrature points on upsampled patches
tol:      integration tolerance
eta:      near/far field cutoff parameter
depth:    maximum recursion depth for adaptive quadrature
order:    order of singular integration
nthreads: number of threads to use in threaded computations
