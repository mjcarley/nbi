* Examples for use of NBI in Laplace and Helmholtz problems

The examples in each directory are run using the scripts
solve-helmholtz and solve-laplace, which can also be used to configure
the problem. Each directory contains scripts make-geometry and
make-visualization-grid which generate the surface mesh and a
visualization mesh, respectively. There are also configurable boundary
condition (source) files which are used in running the tests.

A number of test cases use a source contained inside the surface. When
the boundary condition is generated in this way, the resulting
solution should be identical to the potential computed using the
interior source. The NBI solver returns error estimates (L_2, L_inf,
and r.m.s.) computed as the difference between the potential specified
in the boundary condition file, and that computed by the solver.

The output from the calculation which be visualized using GMSH is two
.msh files, one named according to the geometry of the problem,
e.g. sphere.msh, and one called grid.msh which shows the computed
field around the surface. 

To run all of the test cases for Laplace and Helmholtz problems:

. test-all-laplace
. test-all-helmholtz

These will enter each directory in turn and run the tests, logging
output to test-[laplace|helmholtz].log and estimated error norms to
test-[laplace|helmholtz]-norm.log

SphereLaplace: solve for the Laplace potential on an ellipsoid
	       (deformed sphere)

SphereHelmholtz: solve for the Helmholtz (wave equation) potential on
		 an ellipsoid under excitation from a sinusoidally varying
		 ring source (this can be used to simulate rotor and
		 propeller noise).

Flow: solve the Laplace equation to compute the potential around a
	  sphere in a uniform flow. The error norms reported by the solver
	  in this case are not meaningful, because the boundary condition
	  is not generated by an internal source. Instead, the accuracy of
	  the result can be checked in Octave, using a script in the
	  directory. The README file in the directory explains how this
	  can be checked using Octave.

Wing: solve the Laplace or Helmholtz problem for a point source inside
      a wing-type geometry, generated using the AGG library. 

Scattering: solve for scattering of a plane wave by a sphere, with
	    comparison to the analytical series solution. The error norms
	    reported by the solver in this case are not meaningful,
	    because the boundary condition is not generated by an internal
	    source. Instead, the accuracy of the result can be checked in
	    Octave, using a script in the directory. The README file in
	    the directory contains instructions on how to perform the
	    check.

Rotor: solve the problem of scattering of noise from an azimuthally
       varying circular source, which simulates a rotor interacting
       with a simple nacelle

Catseye: solve for a point source inside a cat's eye geometry,
	 generated using a GMSH input file. This is run by both the
	 Laplace and Helmholtz test scripts.
