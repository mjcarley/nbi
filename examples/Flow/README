The results of the potential flow calculation can be checked using the
sphpot function in the octave subdirectory, using the script
sphcheck.m. You need to add the path to the octave subdirectory of the
nbi distribution, and then run the script.

>> addpath(".../path/to/octave/functions/") ;
>> sphcheck

This will give an error estimate which is the absolute value of the
maximum difference between the computed potential and the analytical
result.
