The results of the plane wave scattering problem can checked using the
sphscat function in the octave subdirectory, using the script
sphcheck.m. You need to add the path to the octave subdirectory of the
nbi distribution, and then run the script.

>> addpath(".../path/to/octave/functions/") ;
>> sphcheck

This will give an error estimate which is the absolute value of the
maximum difference between the computed scattered field and the result
from evaluating the exact series solution.
