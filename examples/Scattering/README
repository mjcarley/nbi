The results of the plane wave scattering problem can checked using the
sphscat function in the octave subdirectory. After adding the octave
subdirectory to the Octave path:

## read grid with computed scattered field
>> [x,n,w] = nbisurf("grid.nbi") ;
## find spherical polar coordinates
>> r = sqrt(sum(x.^2,2)) ;
>> th = acos(x(:,3)./r) ;
## read field data and convert to complex field amplitude
>> f = nbidata("grid.dat") ;
>> f = f(:,1:2)*[1; j] ;
## calculate scattered field for sphere of radius 0.5 and wavenumber 10
>> p = sphscat(0.5, r, th, 10) ;
## find points in field lying outside the scattering sphere
>> ii = find(r > 0.55) ;
## find error estimate for field
>> err = max(abs(p(ii) - f(ii)))/max(abs(p(ii)))
