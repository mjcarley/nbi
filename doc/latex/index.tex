NBI is a library and a collection of tools for solving the Laplace and Helmholtz problems using Nystrom Boundary Integral methods, with Fast Multipole Method acceleration.\doxysection{Getting started}\label{index_start}
NBI has a number of tools for generating surfaces and solving the Laplace and Helmholtz problems on those surfaces, subject to user-\/defined boundary conditions. The examples subdirectory of the distribution contains a number of scripts showing how to run the codes and generate results. Details of command line options for the computation executables can be found using the `-\/h' for help option.

The main steps in solving a problem are\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item generate a geometry using {\ttfamily nbi-\/surface} 
\item generate a matrix for the problem using {\ttfamily nbi-\/assemble-\/laplace} or {\ttfamily nbi-\/assemble-\/helmholtz} 
\item solve the problem with the prescribed boundary conditions using {\ttfamily nbi-\/solve-\/laplace} or {\ttfamily nbi-\/solve-\/helmholtz} 
\item if required, compute the field outside the surface using {\ttfamily nbi-\/field-\/laplace} or {\ttfamily nbi-\/field-\/helmholtz} 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Results can be visualized using {\ttfamily nbi-\/process} to generate mesh files which can be viewed using {\ttfamily gmsh}, available from {\texttt{ https\+://www.\+gmsh.\+info/}}\doxysection{References}\label{index_references}
The following papers and reports have been used in developing NBI. The main theory and method is that of Greengard et al. Other papers are used in developing the FMM library wbfmm and are listed here for completeness.
