 * @mainpage NBI: Nystrom Boundary Integral calculations
 *
 * NBI is a library and a collection of tools for solving the Laplace
 * and Helmholtz problems using Nystrom Boundary Integral methods,
 * with Fast Multipole Method acceleration.
 *
 * @section start Getting started
 *
 * NBI has a number of tools for generating surfaces and solving the
 * Laplace and Helmholtz problems on those surfaces, subject to
 * user-defined boundary conditions. The examples subdirectory of the
 * distribution contains a number of scripts showing how to run the
 * codes and generate results. Details of command line options for the
 * computation executables can be found using the `-h' for help
 *  option.
 *
 * The main steps in solving a problem are:
 *
 * -# generate a geometry using \c nbi-surface
 * -# generate a matrix for the problem using \c nbi-assemble-laplace or
 * \c nbi-assemble-helmholtz
 * -# solve the problem with the prescribed boundary conditions using
 * \c nbi-solve-laplace or \c nbi-solve-helmholtz
 * -# if required, compute the field outside the surface using
 * \c nbi-field-laplace or \c nbi-field-helmholtz
 *
 * Results can be visualized using \c nbi-process to generate mesh files
 * which can be viewed using \c gmsh, available from https://www.gmsh.info/
