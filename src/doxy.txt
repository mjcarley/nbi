 * @mainpage Nystrom Boundary Integral calculations
 *
 * NBI is a library and a collection of tools for solving the Laplace
 * and Helmholtz problems using Nystrom Boundary Integral methods,
 * with Fast Multipole Method acceleration.
 *
 * @section start Getting started
 *
 * NBI has a number of tools for generating surfaces and solving the
 * Laplace and Helmholtz problems on those surfaces, subject to
 * user-defined boundary conditions. The examples subdirectory of the
 * distribution contains a number of scripts showing how to run the
 * codes and generate results. Details of command line options for the
 * computation executables can be found using the `-h' for help
 *  option.
 *
 * The main steps in solving a problem are:
 *
 * -# generate a geometry using \c nbi-surface
 * -# assemble matrices for the problem using \c nbi-assemble-laplace or
 * \c nbi-assemble-helmholtz
 * -# solve the problem with the prescribed boundary conditions using
 * \c nbi-solve-laplace or \c nbi-solve-helmholtz
 * -# if required, compute the field outside the surface using
 * \c nbi-field-laplace or \c nbi-field-helmholtz
 *
 * Results can be visualized using \c nbi-process to generate mesh files
 * which can be viewed using \c gmsh, available from
 * https://www.gmsh.info/
 *
 * @section examples Examples
 *
 * A number of examples showing the use of NBI are available in the
 *  .../examples directory. A basic calculation for the Helmholtz
 * problem would be:
 *
 * @verbatim	
 nbi-surface -g ellipsoid-ico -i 2 -o sphere.nbi
 nbi-assemble -k 3.0 -d 5 -g sphere.nbi -m matrix.dat
 nbi-solve-helmholtz -b point.bc -f -s solution.dat -k 3.0
 @endverbatim
 *
 * This generates a spherical surface as a twice refined icosahedron;
 * assembles the problem matrices for a wavenumber \f$k=3\f$; solves
 * for a boundary condition given in the file point.bc
 *
 * More details are available on how to use the NBI executables to set
 * up and solve problems, and to process the results
